# FantyHelper

Links the C/C++ dependencies together to form one uniform static library file. *(And some helper functions.)* 
This makes it easier to link into and distribute.

## Building

Windows:
* Download premake v5.0.0 from https://github.com/premake/premake-core/tags
* Place premake5.exe into `vendor/premake/bin/`
* Run `GenerateProjects.bat`, this will generate the Visual Studio project files needed to compile.
